# Bamazon
This is a comman line based store with the interface of the customer. The application uses the npm inquirer package and the MySQL database with the npm mysql package. You must have the MySQL data set up on your machine in order to run this application. Within your MySQL, you need to create a database titles Bamazon with a product table (see Bamazon.sql). Once your database is populated, you will be able to run the Bamazon customer interface.
Within the customer interface, the user can view the inventory of the store items within the Products table. The product table include an item ID, item description, department, price, and quantity. The user can then purchase one of the items by typing in the item ID number and choosing a quantity. If the quantity the user chose is in stock, the application will congratulate the user and list the total price of the purchases. If the item is not in stock to their desired quantity, they will be informed.
